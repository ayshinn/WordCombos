How to use this program: 
On the command line, create an executable with 'make cook'
Run with the following command:

./cook dictionary.txt elrtt

(replace 'elrtts' with any combination of letters you'd like)
You may also use your own dictionary file by replacing dictionary.txt with a similarly formatted text file of your own.

For special rounds in the WordCookies game: run with modified command as so:

./cook dictionary.txt elrtt s

Where the s is any additional letter that is added and must be contained in the word
